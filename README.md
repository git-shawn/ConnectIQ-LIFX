# LIFX Controller

LIFX Controller is an application for Garmin watches built to control your LIFX lights. This repository is a fork of the awesome [ConnectIQ-LIFX](https://github.com/cfculhane/ConnectIQ-LIFX) updated to support modern AMOLED Garmin devices.

You need your own API key to use this app, but don't worryâ€”it's free and super easy to get.

## Download
LIFX Controller is available for most Garmin watches on the [Connect IQ store](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/9fe982ff-674d-41c9-88bc-81b357408831).

## Building
Build using VSCode with the Monkey C Extension. For help, check out [Garmin's Guide](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/reference-guides/visual-studio-code-extension/) to Monkey C in Visual Code.
